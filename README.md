# Hi, I'm Arnaud! 👋

🇨🇭 I'm from Switzerland and currently completing my **Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering** at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

🚀 My interests include physics, embedded systems, simulation, and creative prototyping.

🔧 I enjoy building things — from Python GUIs and Arduino interfaces to finite element solvers and video tracking tools.

📸 Outside of work, I love photography, skiing, and tinkering with 3D printers!
